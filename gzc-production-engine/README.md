# GZC Production Engine Analysis

**Analyst**: Software_Research_Analyst  
**Date**: 2025-07-01  
**Status**: In Progress

## Project Overview

Comprehensive technical analysis of the GZC Production Engine prototype, consisting of four interconnected TypeScript repositories that form a complete trading/portfolio management system.

## Repository Structure

```
gzc-production-engine/
├── repositories/
│   ├── fx-client/         # FX trading client application
│   ├── gzc-ui/            # Shared UI component library
│   ├── gzc-portfolio-app/ # Portfolio management application
│   └── gzc-main-shell/    # Main application shell/container
└── analysis/              # Analysis documentation and findings
```

## Analysis Objectives

1. **System Architecture**: Understand how the four repositories work together
2. **Technology Stack**: Document frameworks, libraries, and dependencies
3. **Integration Points**: Map communication between components
4. **Local Setup**: Create reproducible local development environment
5. **Production Readiness**: Assess deployment patterns and scalability
