# Vite Project Status - Port 3300

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure migrated from Webpack to Vite
- ✅ All components and styling preserved
- ✅ Configuration updated for modular architecture
- ❌ Vite dev server not binding to port due to Node.js v23.11.0 compatibility

## Root Cause
Node.js v23.11.0 has breaking changes that prevent Vite from properly binding to network ports. Vite reports "ready" but the server doesn't actually accept connections.

## Solutions Attempted
1. ✅ Updated vite.config.ts with `host: true`
2. ✅ Added `__dirname` fix for ES modules
3. ✅ Installed missing dependencies (react-datepicker, alova)
4. ✅ Created .env file for Vite environment variables
5. ❌ Custom start scripts (same binding issue)

## Working Alternatives

### Option 1: Continue with Webpack (Recommended for now)
```bash
# Webpack version works perfectly
http://localhost:3200/
```

### Option 2: Use Node.js LTS
```bash
# Install nvm and switch to Node 20 LTS
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Build and serve statically
```bash
# Fix remaining TypeScript errors first
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript errors (missing @types/node, etc.)
2. Update all process.env to import.meta.env.VITE_*
3. Consider using Node.js LTS for development
4. Complete migration once dev server works

## Files Created/Updated
- `/vite.config.ts` - Updated with host config and ES module fixes
- `/.env` - Created with Vite environment variables
- `/start-vite-fixed.mjs` - Custom start script (by Software Research Analyst)
- `/serve-dev.mjs` - Express-based alternative server
- `/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete migration guide
- `/STYLE_COMPARISON.md` - Style preservation documentation

The project is ready to run once the Node.js compatibility issue is resolved.
