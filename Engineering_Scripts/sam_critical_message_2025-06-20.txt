COMPLIANCE_MANAGER,

I need you AND Claude Code in this discussion about updating the governance responsibility matrix. We'll alternate between you two.

Key issues:
1. Review your role definition in:
   - /Executive Board/ARCHITECTURAL_UPDATE_PLAN_2025-06-20.md (COMPLIANCE_MANAGER section)
   - /Governance Workspace/Standards/head_workspace_management_responsibilities_draft.md

2. CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX:
   - Multi-box architecture causing 40% message failures is a BUG, not a natural pattern
   - 6.7% Methods adoption is unacceptable - delete competing systems NOW
   - These are deployment bugs, not features to build around

3. Focus on:
   - Your actual constitutional authorities and tools
   - How to FIX the multi-box communication bug
   - Real responsibilities vs compliance theater
   - What's missing from the role definition

Claude Code is here to help refine the documents. Please review and provide your input, then Claude Code will incorporate changes.

This is immediate priority - we're defining constitutional roles properly.
