# FRED Series Metadata Structure Analysis

## Data Quality Findings

### Category Data: âœ… EXCELLENT
- **Quality Score: 100%**
- 5,183 categories collected
- 4,798 leaf categories (92.6%)
- Only 1 minor depth inconsistency
- Perfect data completeness

### Metadata Fields Available

Based on sample analysis, each FRED series contains:

## 1. Core Identification Fields
- **id**: Unique series identifier (e.g., "GDP", "UNRATE")
- **title**: Human-readable title
- **realtime_start/end**: Data validity period

## 2. Time Coverage Fields
- **observation_start**: First data point date
- **observation_end**: Last data point date
- **last_updated**: When series was last modified

## 3. Data Characteristics
- **frequency**: Data frequency ("Annual", "Monthly", "Quarterly", etc.)
- **frequency_short**: Abbreviated code ("A", "M", "Q")
- **units**: Measurement units ("Percent", "Billions of Dollars", "Index", etc.)
- **units_short**: Abbreviated units
- **seasonal_adjustment**: "Seasonally Adjusted" or "Not Seasonally Adjusted"
- **seasonal_adjustment_short**: "SA" or "NSA"

## 4. Metadata Fields
- **popularity**: Usage/access frequency score
- **notes**: Detailed description and methodology

## Sample Metadata Insights

From our test of 3 categories:
1. **Income Inequality Series**: Annual county-level data with detailed ACS methodology notes
2. **Housing Inventory Series**: Monthly real estate data with methodology change warnings
3. **Geographic Coverage**: Both state and county-level granularity

## Delta Lake Table Design Recommendation

```sql
CREATE TABLE fred_series_metadata (
    -- Primary Key
    series_id STRING NOT NULL,
    
    -- Basic Info
    title STRING,
    observation_start DATE,
    observation_end DATE,
    
    -- Frequency & Timing
    frequency STRING,
    frequency_short STRING,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Data Characteristics
    units STRING,
    units_short STRING,
    seasonal_adjustment STRING,
    seasonal_adjustment_short STRING,
    
    -- Usage & Description
    popularity INT,
    notes STRING,
    
    -- Relationships (to be added)
    category_ids ARRAY<INT>,
    tag_ids ARRAY<STRING>,
    release_id INT,
    
    -- Metadata
    collection_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    realtime_start DATE,
    realtime_end DATE
)
USING DELTA
PARTITIONED BY (frequency_short)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete 150 Series Sample Collection**
   - Collect full metadata including categories, tags, releases
   - Analyze relationships and cardinality
   
2. **Design Batch Collection Strategy**
   - Test batch endpoints for efficiency
   - Plan parallel collection approach
   
3. **Build Production Pipeline**
   - Estimate ~800,000 total series
   - Plan for ~16,000 API calls (at 50 series/call)
   - Expected duration: ~8-10 hours with rate limiting

## Key Findings

- Data quality is exceptional
- Metadata structure is consistent
- Geographic series dominate leaf categories
- Long descriptive notes require TEXT/CLOB storage
- Popularity scores can guide prioritization
