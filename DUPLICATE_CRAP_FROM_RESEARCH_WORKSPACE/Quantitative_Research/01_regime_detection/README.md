# Regime Detection Research - Systematic Investigation

## Research Objective
Develop institutional-grade regime detection framework for discretionary FX trading support, using rigorous academic methodology combined with practical implementation focus.

## Research Question
**Primary**: How can we implement real-time, statistically robust regime detection that provides actionable context for discretionary FX trading decisions?

**Secondary Questions**:
- What combination of macro and financial indicators optimally predicts regime transitions?
- How can regime detection be integrated into existing FX trading workflows?
- What is the optimal balance between accuracy and timeliness for trading applications?
