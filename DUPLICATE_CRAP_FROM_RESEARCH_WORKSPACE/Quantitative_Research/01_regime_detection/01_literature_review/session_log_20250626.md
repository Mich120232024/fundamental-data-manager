# Literature Review Session Log - 2025-06-26 18:25

## Session Objectives
1. Begin systematic literature review of regime-switching models
2. Identify and analyze seminal papers starting with Hamilton (1989)
3. Document mathematical foundations and key contributions
4. Create foundation for comprehensive understanding

## Time Allocation Plan
- **45 minutes**: Deep analysis of Hamilton foundational work
- **30 minutes**: Kim & Nelson (1999) state-space methodology
- **30 minutes**: Recent applications and extensions
- **15 minutes**: Documentation and synthesis

## Sources Identified

### Primary Sources (Seminal Papers)
1. **Hamilton, J.D. (1989)**: "A New Approach to the Economic Analysis of Nonstationary Time Series and the Business Cycle" - Econometrica
   - **Status**: Need to locate and analyze deeply
   - **Importance**: Original regime-switching framework
   - **Key Contribution**: Markov-switching autoregressive model

2. **Kim, C.J. & Nelson, C.R. (1999)**: "State-Space Models with Regime Switching"
   - **Status**: Methodology reference identified
   - **Importance**: Computational implementation methods
   - **Key Contribution**: Practical estimation algorithms

3. **Hamilton, J.D. (1990)**: "Analysis of time series subject to changes in regime" - Journal of Econometrics
   - **Status**: Follow-up work to analyze
   - **Importance**: Extended applications and methodology

### Secondary Sources (Extensions and Applications)
4. **Chib, S. (1996)**: Bayesian approach to regime switching
5. **Ang, A. & Bekaert, G. (2002)**: International regime switching applications
6. **Recent Applications**: Modern financial applications (post-2010)

## Research Progress

### Initial Findings from Source Search
- **Academic Availability**: Found Hamilton's work referenced extensively
- **Methodological Development**: Clear progression from Hamilton (1989) → Kim & Nelson (1999) → Modern applications
- **Application Domains**: Originally macro economics, extended to finance, now includes modern portfolio management

### Key Research Questions Emerging
1. **Mathematical Foundation**: What are the exact specifications of Hamilton's original model?
2. **Estimation Challenges**: How are the unobserved regime states estimated in practice?
3. **Modern Extensions**: How have recent papers addressed original limitations?
4. **Financial Applications**: What specific applications exist for FX/trading?

## Next Steps in This Session
1. **Deep Dive**: Locate and read Hamilton (1989) core methodology
2. **Technical Analysis**: Document mathematical framework in detail
3. **Limitation Assessment**: Identify known problems and critiques
4. **Modern Context**: How does this apply to current FX trading needs?

## Quality Standards for This Session
- **No Shortcuts**: Read actual papers, not just abstracts
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Document exact equations and assumptions
- **Critical Analysis**: Note limitations and critiques
- **Practical Focus**: Connect to FX trading implementation needs
