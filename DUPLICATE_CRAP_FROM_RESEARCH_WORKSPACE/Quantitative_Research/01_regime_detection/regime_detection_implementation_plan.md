# Regime Detection Implementation Plan - Iterative Analysis

## ITERATION 2: HYPOTHESIS TESTING & ANALYSIS

### Scientific Method Applied to Regime Detection

#### OBSERVE (Completed)
- **Business Need**: Discretionary FX trading requires regime context for decision support
- **Available Data**: FRED API (827k series), FX trading infrastructure, Azure/PostgreSQL platform  
- **Current Capability**: Real-time FX data, portfolio positions, P&L calculation
- **Gap**: No systematic regime detection for market context

#### QUESTION (Completed)
- **Primary**: How can we implement real-time regime detection for FX trading decisions?
- **Secondary**: What indicators predict regime changes with actionable lead time?
- **Technical**: How do we integrate this with existing FX trading platform?
- **Performance**: What accuracy/speed requirements for trading support?

#### HYPOTHESIZE (In Progress)

**HYPOTHESIS 1**: Hamilton-Style Macro Regime Detection
```
H1: We can detect economic regimes using 3-4 key FRED indicators:
   - GDP Growth Rate (quarterly) → FRED: GDPC1
   - Unemployment Rate (monthly) → FRED: UNRATE  
   - Core CPI Inflation (monthly) → FRED: CPILFESL
   - Federal Funds Rate (daily) → FRED: FEDFUNDS

Expected Regimes:
   - Expansion: GDP growth >2%, unemployment declining, inflation 2-3%
   - Recession: GDP growth <0%, unemployment rising, rates cutting
   - Stagflation: GDP growth <1%, unemployment >6%, inflation >4%
   - Recovery: GDP accelerating, unemployment peak/declining, rates low
```

**HYPOTHESIS 2**: Financial Stress Regime Detection  
```
H2: Financial markets regimes can be detected using:
   - VIX (volatility) → Market fear
   - Credit spreads → Liquidity conditions
   - Yield curve shape → Growth expectations
   - Dollar index strength → Global risk appetite

This gives faster signals than macro data (real-time vs monthly/quarterly)
```

**HYPOTHESIS 3**: Hybrid Approach for FX Trading
```
H3: Combine macro (slow, accurate) + financial (fast, noisy) signals:
   - Macro regime = Background context (expansion/recession/recovery)
   - Financial regime = Short-term environment (risk-on/risk-off/stressed)
   - FX Trading Rule = Regime-dependent position sizing and currency selection
```

#### TEST (Current Phase)

**TEST 1: Data Availability and Quality**
```python
# Key FRED Series for Regime Detection
REGIME_INDICATORS = {
    'macro': {
        'GDP': 'GDPC1',           # Real GDP (quarterly)
        'UNEMPLOYMENT': 'UNRATE', # Unemployment rate (monthly)  
        'INFLATION': 'CPILFESL',  # Core CPI (monthly)
        'FED_FUNDS': 'FEDFUNDS'   # Fed funds rate (daily)
    },
    'financial': {
        'VIX': 'VIXCLS',          # VIX volatility index
        'CREDIT_SPREAD': 'BAA',   # BAA corporate bond rate
        'TREASURY_10Y': 'DGS10',  # 10-year treasury rate
        'DOLLAR_INDEX': 'DTWEXBGS' # Trade-weighted dollar index
    }
}

# Implementation Test Plan:
1. Extract 20 years of data for each indicator
2. Calculate growth rates and changes
3. Apply simple regime classification rules
4. Validate against known recession periods (2008, 2020)
5. Measure regime transition detection accuracy
```

**TEST 2: Statistical Model Implementation**
```python
# Hamilton Model Implementation Test
class HamiltonRegimeModel:
    def __init__(self, n_regimes=2):
        self.n_regimes = n_regimes
        self.transition_probs = None
        self.regime_means = None
        self.regime_variances = None
    
    def fit(self, data):
        # Maximum likelihood estimation
        # EM algorithm for hidden Markov model
        pass
    
    def predict_regime_probabilities(self, current_data):
        # Real-time regime probability calculation
        # Return: [prob_regime_1, prob_regime_2, ...]
        pass
    
    def detect_regime_change(self, threshold=0.7):
        # Signal regime change when probability > threshold
        pass

# Test Plan:
1. Implement basic 2-regime model for GDP growth
2. Test on historical data 1970-2024
3. Compare regime dates to NBER recession dating
4. Measure false positive/negative rates
5. Optimize parameters for FX trading use case
```

**TEST 3: Integration with FX Trading System**
```python
# Integration Test with Existing FX Platform
class FXRegimeIntegration:
    def __init__(self, fx_trading_service, regime_detector):
        self.fx_service = fx_trading_service
        self.regime_detector = regime_detector
    
    def get_regime_adjusted_position_size(self, base_size, currency_pair):
        current_regime = self.regime_detector.get_current_regime()
        
        # Regime-dependent position sizing
        if current_regime == 'recession':
            return base_size * 0.5  # Reduce risk
        elif current_regime == 'expansion':
            return base_size * 1.2  # Increase risk
        else:
            return base_size
    
    def get_preferred_currencies(self):
        regime = self.regime_detector.get_current_regime()
        
        # Regime-dependent currency preferences
        if regime == 'risk_off':
            return ['USD', 'CHF', 'JPY']  # Safe havens
        elif regime == 'risk_on':
            return ['AUD', 'CAD', 'NOK']  # Risk currencies
        else:
            return ['EUR', 'GBP']  # Neutral
```

#### ANALYZE (Planned Next Steps)

**Analysis Framework**:
1. **Statistical Validation**: Does model detect known regimes accurately?
2. **Economic Validation**: Do detected regimes make economic sense?
3. **Trading Validation**: Do regime-based rules improve trading performance?
4. **Performance Analysis**: Speed, accuracy, false signal rates

**Success Metrics**:
- Regime detection accuracy: >80% vs NBER dating
- False positive rate: <20% 
- Signal lead time: 1-3 months for macro, 1-7 days for financial
- FX trading improvement: Sharpe ratio increase >0.2

#### CONCLUDE (Final Phase)

**Expected Deliverables**:
1. **Production Regime Detection Service**: Real-time regime probabilities
2. **FX Trading Integration**: Regime-aware position sizing and currency selection
3. **Dashboard**: Regime visualization for discretionary traders
4. **Documentation**: Model methodology, validation results, usage guidelines

        return recommendations
```

## Engineering Discussion Topics

- Database query optimization for regime time series

### 4. Integration Points
**System Integration Requirements**:
