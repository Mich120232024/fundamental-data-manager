# FX Spot Stream Project Analysis

## Project Overview

**FX Spot Stream** is a professional-grade institutional FX trading platform designed for real-time foreign exchange operations. It's a multi-component system that enables banks and financial institutions to:

1. **Stream real-time FX market data** 
2. **Execute spot FX trades** through multiple protocols
3. **Manage order lifecycles** with institutional-grade controls
4. **Integrate with major liquidity providers** via industry-standard FIX protocol

## System Architecture

### 1. Backend Core (fx-spot-stream/)
- **Technology**: Python Flask with gevent/WebSocket support
- **Purpose**: Trading engine and market data processor
- **Key Components**:
  - FIX protocol engine for institutional trading standards
  - WebSocket server for real-time data streaming
  - Order management system with FOK/IOC execution types
  - Market data subscription and distribution
  - SSL/TLS security with certificate-based authentication

### 2. Frontend Interface (fx-client/)
- **Technology**: React 19 + TypeScript + Bootstrap
- **Purpose**: Trader workstation interface
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time quote display (ESP and RFS protocols)
  - Interactive trade execution interface
  - Live trade execution monitoring
  - Virtual trading mode for testing
  - WebSocket integration for streaming data

### 3. Deployment Infrastructure (fxspotstream-chart/)
- **Technology**: Kubernetes Helm charts
- **Purpose**: Production deployment orchestration
- **Features**:
  - Horizontal pod autoscaling (1-100 replicas)
  - Load balancing and service mesh
  - Health checks and monitoring
  - Ingress configuration for external access

### 4. Data Integration (fx-option-importer/)
- **Purpose**: Imports and processes FX options data
- **Integration**: Feeds data into the main trading platform

## Trading Protocols Supported

### ESP (Executable Streaming Pricing)
- Real-time streaming quotes that can be immediately executed
- Continuous market data feed
- Low-latency execution

### RFS (Request for Stream)
- On-demand quote requests
- Broken date trading support
- Custom settlement dates

### Advanced Features
- **NDF (Non-Deliverable Forwards)** support
- **Pre-trade allocations** for institutional workflows
- **Multiple execution types**: Fill-or-Kill, Immediate-or-Cancel, Slippage, VWAP

## Control and Management

### 1. Operational Control Points

**Environment Configuration**:
```yaml
FIX_SOCKET_HOST: Trading server endpoint
FIX_TRADING_PORT: Protocol port (default 9110)  
FIX_USERNAME/PASSWORD: Authentication credentials
SSL_CERT_PATH/SSL_KEY_PATH: Security certificates
```

**Connection Management**:
- Start/stop FIX connections via REST API endpoints
- Monitor connection health and session status
- Handle authentication and session recovery

### 2. Trading Controls

**Risk Management**:
- Virtual trading mode for testing strategies
- Quote selection and validation before execution
- Trade request logging and audit trails

**Market Data Control**:
- Subscribe/unsubscribe to currency pairs
- Configure quote refresh intervals
- Manage data feed priorities

### 3. System Administration

**Deployment Control**:
- Kubernetes scaling (1-100 pod replicas)
- Resource allocation (CPU/memory limits)
- Load balancing and traffic routing

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Application logs via structured logging
- FIX message audit trail
- WebSocket connection monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking

### 4. Business Logic Control

**Liquidity Provider Management**:
- Connect to multiple bank liquidity sources
- Route orders based on pricing/execution quality
- Manage provider-specific protocols

**Trading Parameters**:
- Currency pair configuration
- Tenor and settlement date management
- Execution algorithm selection (FOK, IOC, etc.)

## Control Interfaces

1. **REST API** (fx-spot-stream/app/controllers/)
   - `/fix/start` - Initialize trading connections
   - `/fix/get_quote` - Request market quotes
   - `/fix/stop` - Terminate connections

2. **WebSocket API** (Real-time data)
   - ESP quote streams
   - RFS quote responses
   - Trade execution confirmations

3. **Web Interface** (fx-client/)
   - Visual quote management
   - Trade execution controls
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard

4. **Kubernetes Management** (fxspotstream-chart/)
   - Deployment scaling
   - Configuration management
   - Service orchestration

## Technical Stack Summary

- **Backend**: Python Flask, gevent, WebSocket
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Bootstrap
- **Protocol**: FIX (Financial Information eXchange)
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Helm charts
- **Security**: SSL/TLS, certificate-based authentication
- **Data**: Real-time streaming, RESTful APIs

This system provides comprehensive control over institutional FX trading operations with professional-grade reliability, security, and scalability.
