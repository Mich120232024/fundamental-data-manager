â€¢ NFCI: 10.8% momentum, +1.98 acceleration
â€¢ UNRATE: 2.4% momentum, +1.61 acceleration
  â†’ Unemployment accelerating = Labor market weakening rapidly
â€¢ T10Y2Y: 25.0% momentum, +0.57 acceleration

ðŸ“‰ DECELERATING MOMENTUM (Negative Acceleration)

Top 5 Decelerating Series:
â€¢ HOUST: -15.7% momentum, -10.25 deceleration
  â†’ Housing starts slowing = Real estate cooling
â€¢ UMCSENT: -27.2% momentum, -9.63 deceleration

ðŸŽ¯ KEY INSIGHTS FOR TRADING/POLICY
==================================
1. INFLATION: Decelerating - Bullish for bonds, dovish Fed possible
2. GROWTH: Decelerating - Risk-off, defensives outperform
4. YIELD CURVE: Steepening - Banks outperform, growth expectations rising

âš¡ MOMENTUM TRADING SIGNALS
==========================
Strong Buy: Series with positive momentum AND positive acceleration
Strong Sell: Series with negative momentum AND negative acceleration  
Reversal Watch: Series where 3M and 12M momentum diverge significantly
Mean Reversion: Series with extreme momentum readings (>Â±20%)

ðŸ“Š STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
==========================
â€¢ Acceleration > 1.0 or < -1.0: Highly significant momentum shift
â€¢ Momentum > 10% or < -10%: Strong directional move
â€¢ Regime changes: Monitor series crossing MA50/MA200
