Mitigation: Cache secrets locally, async refresh

Risk: Cost overrun
Mitigation: Daily cost monitoring, auto-scaling limits
```

### **Compliance Risks**
```yaml
Risk: Data residency violations
Mitigation: Swiss Key Vault for sensitive data

Risk: Audit trail gaps
Mitigation: Comprehensive logging to Azure Monitor

Risk: Access control bypass
Mitigation: Azure AD integration, RBAC enforcement
```

## Disaster Recovery

### **Backup Strategy**
```yaml
Cluster Configuration:
  - Infrastructure as Code (ARM templates)
  - GitOps deployment manifests
  - Configuration backup daily
