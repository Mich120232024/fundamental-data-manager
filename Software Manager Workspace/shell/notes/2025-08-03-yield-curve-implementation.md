## Subject: USD OIS Yield Curve Implementation - Complete Process Documentation

### Executive Summary
Successfully implemented a complete USD OIS yield curve with proper data discovery, validation, storage, and visualization. The process is now fully documented and ready for replication across other currencies.

### Technical Achievement
1. **Data Coverage**: Full USD SOFR OIS curve from overnight (O/N) to 30 years
2. **Visualization**: Implemented three-segment scale giving equal visual weight to short (0-1Y), medium (1-5Y), and long (5-30Y) tenors
3. **Dynamic Features**: Range slider zoom (1-30Y) with logarithmic scale option

### Process Documentation

#### Step 1: Ticker Discovery
- Used Bloomberg API ticker discovery endpoint
- Searched for OIS tickers by currency
- Pattern identified: USD uses USSO* naming convention

#### Step 2: Validation
- Verified all tickers return live prices
- Confirmed SOFRRATE Index for overnight rate
- Validated monthly tickers (USSOA, USSOB, USSOC)

#### Step 3: Database Implementation
Critical learnings:
- PostgreSQL schema has strict constraints
- Minimal required fields: bloomberg_ticker, currency_code, category, tenor, tenor_numeric, curve_name
- Tenor_numeric must be in days for consistency
- Special cases: O/N=1, 1M=30, 3M=90, 1Y=365

#### Step 4: Gateway Logic
Implemented intelligent tenor conversion:
```python
# Overnight
if ticker == 'SOFRRATE Index':
    tenor_days = 1
# Monthly already in days  
elif ticker in ['USSOA', 'USSOB', 'USSOC']:
    tenor_days = tenor_numeric
# Long-term years to days
elif ticker in ['USSO15', 'USSO20', 'USSO30']:
    tenor_days = tenor_numeric * 365
```

#### Step 5: Frontend Enhancement
Three-segment scale implementation:
- Segment 1 (0-33% width): 0 to 1 year
- Segment 2 (33-66% width): 1 to 5 years  
- Segment 3 (66-100% width): 5 to 30 years

Visual improvements:
- Background shading to show segments
- Dynamic tick placement
- Smooth curve interpolation

### Issues Resolved
1. **Missing overnight rate**: Added SOFRRATE Index
2. **Short-term ticker positioning**: Fixed tenor_days calculation
3. **Curve compression**: Implemented three-segment scale
4. **Database constraints**: Used minimal column approach

### Replication Guide for Other Currencies

#### EUR OIS
- Overnight: ESTR Index
- Pattern: EESWE* (e.g., EESWE1M, EESWE1Y)
- Curve name: EUR_OIS

#### GBP OIS  
- Overnight: SONIA Index
- Pattern: SONIO* (e.g., SONIOA BGN Curncy)
- Curve name: GBP_OIS

#### JPY OIS
- Overnight: MUTKCALM Index (TONAR)
- Pattern: JYSO* (e.g., JYSOA BGN Curncy)
- Curve name: JPY_OIS

### Quality Metrics
- Data points: 17 tickers covering full curve
- Update frequency: Real-time from Bloomberg
- Visualization: Professional-grade with institutional features

### Next Actions
1. Implement EUR OIS curve following same process
2. Add GBP and JPY curves
3. Consider adding spread analysis between curves
4. Implement historical comparison features

### Files Modified
- `/tools/bloomberg-gateway-enhanced.py` - Added tenor conversion logic
- `/src/components/YieldCurvesTab.tsx` - Implemented three-segment scale
- Database: Added SOFRRATE Index and corrected tenor values

### Conclusion
The implementation demonstrates systematic approach to financial data integration. Process is documented, tested, and ready for expansion to full G10 currency coverage.
