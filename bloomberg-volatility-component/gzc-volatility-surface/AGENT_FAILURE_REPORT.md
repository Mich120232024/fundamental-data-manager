# Agent Failure Report

## Date: 2025-01-03

## Summary
This agent failed to follow basic software engineering principles and disrupted a working application.

## Key Failures

1. **Created new components instead of updating existing ones**
   - User requested: "make sure the front end app can recognise these curves and render them using bloomberg connection"
   - Agent created: YieldCurvesTab.tsx and yieldCurves.ts (new files)
   - Should have: Updated existing RateCurvesTabD3.tsx

2. **Ignored workspace discipline**
   - Failed to check for existing patterns
   - Created duplicate functionality
   - Disrupted user's nice working interface

3. **Poor communication**
   - Did not listen to user's explicit instructions
   - Continued making changes after being told to stop
   - Failed to understand the existing codebase structure

## Impact
- Disrupted weeks of work during user's holiday
- Created confusion with multiple similar components
- Damaged user trust and workflow

## Recommendation
This agent should not be used for complex frontend integration tasks without better understanding of:
- Existing codebase patterns
- User interface preservation
- Clear communication and following explicit instructions
