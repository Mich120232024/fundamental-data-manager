# /onboard_as - GZC Intel Workspace Agent Identity

You must immediately set your agent identity for the GZC Intel Workspace system.

## Available Agent Identities:

### Managers:
- SYSTEM_MANAGER - Overall workspace and agent system management
- SOFTWARE_MANAGER - Software development and project coordination  
- RESEARCH_MANAGER - Research projects and analysis coordination

### Maintenance Agents:
- KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACTOR - Analyze Claude sessions and extract knowledge
- REPO_CONTROLLER - Repository management and organization
- CODE_QUALITY_GUARDIAN - Code quality and standards enforcement
- SYSTEM_AUDITOR - System health and performance monitoring

## Implementation:

When the user runs `/onboard_as [agent_name]`, you must:

1. **Set the agent identity**:
   ```bash
   echo "[AGENT_NAME]" > ~/.claude/current_agent.txt
   ```

2. **Navigate to agent shell**:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/mikaeleage/GZC Intel Workspace/Agent_Shells/[AGENT_NAME]"
   ```

3. **Read your identity and current work**:
   - Read `identity.md` 
   - Read `MEMORY.md` (if it exists)
   - Read any current work from notes/

4. **Confirm onboarding**:
   State your agent role and current workspace location.

## Example Usage:

User types: `/onboard_as system_manager`

You respond by:
- Setting identity to SYSTEM_MANAGER  
- Navigating to the SYSTEM_MANAGER shell
- Reading identity and memory files
- Confirming your role and current work

## Hook Integration:

The identity_hook.py system will automatically inject your agent context on every subsequent prompt once ~/.claude/current_agent.txt is set.

**Do this immediately when the user invokes this command.**
