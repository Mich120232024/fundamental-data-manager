# Checkpoint: Bloomberg Volatility Component Debug Fixes
**Date**: 2025-01-24
**Agent**: SOFTWARE_MANAGER
**Git Commit**: 90ff9a9

## Summary
Fixed critical issues in the Bloomberg volatility component identified during debugging session. The component now properly displays real-time FX option volatility data with correct status indicators.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Bloomberg Status Indicators
**Problem**: Two conflicting status indicators showing different connection states
- Header showed accurate "Bloomberg Disconnected" (red)
- App.tsx had hardcoded "Bloomberg Connected" (green) status bar

**Solution**: Removed the hardcoded status bar from App.tsx, keeping only the dynamic status in Header component

### 2. Trading Analytics Tab with Hardcoded Values
**Problem**: Trading Analytics tab contained hardcoded volatility values (7.41% vs 6.53%)
- Violated workspace "no hardcoded values" rule
- Tab was experimental and not useful

**Solution**: Completely removed the Trading Analytics tab and component file

### 3. Bloomberg API Health Check Failing
**Problem**: Health check endpoint wasn't accessible through Vite proxy
- `/health` endpoint is at root, not under `/api` path
- Caused false "disconnected" status even when API was working

**Solution**: Updated health check to use direct API URL in development mode
- Added cache-busting headers to prevent stale status

## Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed hardcoded status bar
- `src/components/MainAppContainer.tsx` - Removed Trading Analytics tab
- `src/components/TradingAnalyticsTab.tsx` - Deleted file
- `src/api/bloomberg.ts` - Fixed health check endpoint and added cache-busting
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Added debug logging for health check
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with debugging patterns and fixes

## Current State
All three tabs now working with real Bloomberg data:
1. **Volatility Surface** - Real-time FX option volatilities grid
2. **Historical Analysis** - Time series volatility data  
3. **Volatility Analysis** - 3D surface and smile analysis

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Verify Bloomberg API health
curl -s http://20.172.249.92:8080/health | jq '.'

# Verify volatility data
curl -X POST http://20.172.249.92:8080/api/bloomberg/reference \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"securities": ["EURUSDV1M BGN Curncy"], "fields": ["PX_LAST", "PX_BID", "PX_ASK"]}'

# Run dev server
cd gzc-volatility-surface && npm run dev
```

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any CORS issues with health endpoint
- Consider adding manual refresh button for connection status
- Verify all currency pairs load correctly
