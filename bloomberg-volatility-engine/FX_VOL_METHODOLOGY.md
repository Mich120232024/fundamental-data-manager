# FX Volatility Surface Methodology

## Market Convention Source

The formulas I used are the standard FX options market convention, not something I invented. Here's the methodology:

## 1. FX Options Quoting Convention

In the FX options market, volatility surfaces are quoted using three components:
- **ATM (At-The-Money)**: The implied volatility for the ATM strike
- **RR (Risk Reversal)**: The difference between call and put volatilities at the same delta
- **BF (Butterfly)**: The excess volatility of the wings over ATM

## 2. Mathematical Definitions

### Risk Reversal (25 Delta):
```
RR(25Δ) = σ(25Δ Call) - σ(25Δ Put)
```

### Butterfly (25 Delta):
```
BF(25Δ) = 0.5 × [σ(25Δ Call) + σ(25Δ Put)] - σ(ATM)
```

## 3. Solving for Individual Volatilities

From these two equations, we can solve for the individual call and put volatilities:

Starting with:
- RR = σ_c - σ_p
- BF = 0.5(σ_c + σ_p) - σ_ATM

Solving the system:
- σ_c + σ_p = 2 × (BF + σ_ATM)
- σ_c - σ_p = RR

Therefore:
- σ(Call) = σ(ATM) + 0.5 × RR + BF
- σ(Put) = σ(ATM) - 0.5 × RR + BF

## 4. Why This Convention?

1. **Market Liquidity**: RR and BF are actively traded structures
2. **Risk Management**: They capture skew (RR) and convexity (BF)
3. **Interpolation**: Easier to interpolate smooth surfaces
4. **Historical Consistency**: Been used since 1990s

## 5. Bloomberg Ticker Mapping

The Bloomberg tickers directly correspond to these market quotes:
- `EURUSDV1M` → ATM 1-month volatility
- `EUR25R1M` → 25-delta risk reversal 1-month
- `EUR25B1M` → 25-delta butterfly 1-month
- `EUR10R1M` → 10-delta risk reversal 1-month
- `EUR10B1M` → 10-delta butterfly 1-month

## 7. Delta Conventions

Note: FX uses different delta conventions:
- **Spot Delta**: Used for EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD
- **Forward Delta**: Used for emerging markets
- **Premium-Adjusted**: Sometimes used for long-dated options

The 25Δ means 25% delta (not 0.25), and in FX:
- 25Δ Put ≈ -25% delta (out-of-the-money put)
- 25Δ Call ≈ 25% delta (out-of-the-money call)

## 8. Practical Validation

You can verify this methodology by:
1. Checking any FX options trading platform (Bloomberg, Reuters)
2. Looking at bank FX options pricing sheets
3. Examining CME FX options settlements
4. Reading ISDA FX definitions

## Example Calculation (EURUSD 1M):
```
Given:
- ATM = 7.64%
- 25Δ RR = -0.045% (puts expensive vs calls)
- 25Δ BF = 0.1575% (wings expensive vs ATM)

Calculate:
- 25Δ Call = 7.64 + 0.5×(-0.045) + 0.1575 = 7.775%
- 25Δ Put = 7.64 - 0.5×(-0.045) + 0.1575 = 7.820%

Verify:
- RR = 7.775 - 7.820 = -0.045% ✓
- BF = 0.5×(7.775 + 7.820) - 7.64 = 0.1575% ✓
```

This is not proprietary - it's the universal FX options market standard used by all major banks and trading desks globally.
