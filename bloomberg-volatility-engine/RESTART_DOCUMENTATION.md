# Bloomberg Volatility Surface Project - Restart Documentation

## Current Status: NEED TO RESTART WITH PROPER RESEARCH

### What We Built (WRONG APPROACH)
- SABR volatility model implementation 
- Custom interpolation algorithms
- Theoretical mathematical models
- Surfaces that don't match Bloomberg Terminal reality

### Core Problem
**We built what we THOUGHT Bloomberg does, not what Bloomberg ACTUALLY does.**

### Bloomberg Terminal Reality (From Screenshots)
- **Volatility Range**: 6.00% to 12.00% (dramatic spread)
- **Surface Shape**: Deep ATM valley, steep wings
- **Data Sources**: Vol Table with 25D RR/BF, 10D RR/BF data
- **Visualization**: Professional 3D surface with clean presentation

### Our Results (INCORRECT)
- **Volatility Range**: 7.5% to 9.5% (too narrow)
- **Surface Shape**: Flat, unnatural curves
- **Methodology**: Theoretical SABR model (wrong)
- **Visualization**: Messy, unreadable surface

## RESTART PLAN

### Phase 1: RESEARCH (Use MCP Servers for Learning)
1. **Research Bloomberg Terminal methodology**
   - How does Bloomberg actually construct FX volatility surfaces?
   - What mathematical models do they use?
   - What data feeds their surface construction?

2. **Research FX volatility surface standards**
   - Industry best practices for FX vol surface construction
   - Standard interpolation/extrapolation methods
   - Professional volatility modeling approaches

3. **Research comparable implementations**
   - How do other trading platforms build vol surfaces?
   - Academic papers on FX volatility surface construction
   - Industry standards and conventions

### Phase 2: DATA VERIFICATION
1. **Verify Bloomberg API data accuracy**
   - Confirm our ATM/RR/BF data matches Bloomberg Terminal
   - Check if we're missing additional data sources
   - Validate ticker formats and data ranges

2. **Understand Bloomberg data structure**
   - Full tenor range (1D to 30Y)
   - Complete delta strikes (5D, 10D, 15D, 25D)
   - Additional volatility surface inputs

### Phase 3: PROPER IMPLEMENTATION
1. **Implement verified methodology** (based on research)
2. **Use correct Bloomberg data sources**
3. **Build exact Bloomberg Terminal replica**
4. **Professional visualization matching Bloomberg**

## CURRENT CODEBASE STATUS

### What Works
- ✅ Bloomberg API connection
- ✅ Raw data fetching (ATM, RR, BF)
- ✅ React/Plotly infrastructure
- ✅ Basic surface rendering framework

### What's Wrong
- ❌ SABR model implementation (theoretical, not Bloomberg's method)
- ❌ Surface calculation logic (produces wrong ranges)
- ❌ Visualization approach (messy, unreadable)
- ❌ Mathematical methodology (assumptions, not facts)

### Key Files to Review/Restart
```
/src/utils/sabrModel.ts - DELETE (wrong approach)
/src/components/VolatilitySurfacePlotly.tsx - RESTART (wrong calculation)
/src/services/bloomberg.ts - VERIFY (data accuracy)
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (RESTART GOALS)

### Data Accuracy
- [ ] Volatility range matches Bloomberg: 6% to 12%
- [ ] Surface shape matches Bloomberg screenshots exactly
- [ ] Hover values match Bloomberg Terminal data

### Professional Quality
- [ ] Clean, readable 3D visualization
- [ ] Bloomberg-style axis labels and formatting
- [ ] Professional color scheme and presentation

### Mathematical Rigor
- [ ] Use Bloomberg's actual methodology (not theoretical models)
- [ ] Implement industry-standard approach (verified via research)
- [ ] Arbitrage-free, mathematically consistent surface

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Start MCP research session** - Learn Bloomberg's actual methodology
2. **Verify Bloomberg data** - Confirm our data matches terminal exactly  
3. **Research industry standards** - Learn proper FX vol surface construction
4. **Delete theoretical code** - Remove SABR model and start fresh
5. **Implement verified approach** - Build exactly what Bloomberg does
