## **🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING**

**API Key Error:**
```bash
❌ ERROR: Please set your FRED_API_KEY environment variable
```
**Solution:** Set your API key: `export FRED_API_KEY='your_key'`

**Category File Not Found:**
```
Warning: Could not load category names: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```
**Solution:** Script will still work, just won't have pretty category names

**Rate Limiting:**
```
❌ Error for category 32145: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests
```
**Solution:** Script has built-in rate limiting (1 call/second)
