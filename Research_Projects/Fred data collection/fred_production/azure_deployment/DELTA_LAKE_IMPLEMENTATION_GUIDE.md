# FRED Delta Lake Implementation Guide

## Quick Summary

### Optimal Delta Lake Format for FRED:

1. **Series Metadata Table**
   - Partition by: `frequency` (D, W, M, Q, A)
   - Z-Order by: `series_id`, `popularity`
   - File size: 128MB

2. **Observations Table** 
   - Partition by: `year`, `month`
   - Z-Order by: `series_id`, `date`
   - File size: 256MB

3. **Categories/Tags/Releases**
   - No partitioning (small tables)
   - Z-Order by primary key
   - File size: 64MB

## Storage Structure
```
/fred-delta-lake/
├── bronze/          # Raw data as collected from API
├── silver/          # Cleaned, structured, partitioned
└── gold/            # Aggregated, analytics-ready
```

## Key Delta Properties
```sql
delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite = true
delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = true
delta.targetFileSize = 128mb
delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true
delta.columnMapping.mode = name
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Run the test notebook** to validate in your environment
2. **Create production tables** using the DDL scripts
3. **Set up maintenance jobs** (OPTIMIZE, VACUUM)
4. **Monitor performance** with provided queries

## Why These Choices?

- **Year/Month partitioning**: Balances partition count with query patterns
- **Z-Ordering**: Optimizes for most common query patterns (by series, by date)
- **File sizes**: Optimized for Synapse Spark processing
- **Auto-optimization**: Reduces maintenance overhead

## Expected Performance

- Series metadata queries: <1 second
- Date range queries: 2-5 seconds  
- Large aggregations: 10-30 seconds
- Full table scans: Avoided through partitioning

This configuration handles 800,000+ series with billions of observations efficiently.
