# FRED Azure Deployment Project
**Multi-Agent Workspace Implementation**

## **üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Mission**: Deploy our complete FRED economic data collection system to Azure using proven event-driven architecture, leveraging all foundation work completed.

**Success Criteria**: 
- ‚úÖ Complete category hierarchy (5,183) deployed to Azure Delta Lake
- ‚úÖ Event-driven collection system operational
- ‚úÖ Parallel processing achieving 10x local performance  
- ‚úÖ Cost under $150/month operational budget
- ‚úÖ 99.9% uptime for data collection

---

## **üìã FOUNDATION ASSETS READY**

### **Local Data Completed:**
```
‚úÖ categories_complete_hierarchy.json (5,183 categories)
‚úÖ Foundation collection scripts (Python)
‚úÖ API analysis complete (31 endpoints documented)
‚úÖ Rate limiting strategies proven
‚úÖ Azure architecture designed
```

### **Azure Strategy Designed:**
```
‚úÖ Event Grid + Azure Functions + Service Bus
‚úÖ Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake Gen2
‚úÖ Parallel worker architecture (10+ workers)
‚úÖ Cost optimization (~$124/month)
‚úÖ Monitoring and observability
```
