## Research Task

I need to research MCP memory server documentation from Anthropic.

Please search for:
1. MCP memory server setup and configuration
2. JSON file format requirements
3. The error "Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1"
4. Memory server initialization process

Check https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp for information.

Focus on understanding why we're getting JSON parsing errors when the JSON file is valid.


## Findings
(Research would be conducted here via Claude API)

## Key Insights
- MCP memory servers require specific JSON structure
- Configuration must match expected schema
- Parsing errors often indicate configuration issues
