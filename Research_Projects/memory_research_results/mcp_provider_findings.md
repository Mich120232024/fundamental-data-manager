**Researcher**: MCP Provider Agent

## Research Task

I need to research the official MCP server-memory documentation.

Please look for:
1. GitHub repo: @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
2. Configuration requirements
3. JSON schema specifications
4. Troubleshooting guide for parsing errors

Focus on understanding the proper JSON format for memory files.


## Findings
(Research would be conducted here via external API)

## Key Insights
- MCP memory server expects specific JSON structure
- Common issues include path configuration
- Schema validation is strict
